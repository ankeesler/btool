# What's the plan?

## Milestone: Link test (with googletest dependency)

### TODO

- how do we want to consume include paths?
  - gaggle.Collector
    - object node.Node -> include path
      * or *
    - always use include paths
  - scanner.Scanner
    - object node.Node -> include path
    - include -> header node.Node
      \- header node.Node -> include path
      \- header node.Node -> libraries

- how do we want to consume libraries?
  - scanner.Scanner
    - include -> node.Node

- what if we did this simply:
  - map from include to include path
  - map from include to library
  - in scanner.Scanner
    - when we try to resolve include, we first try current directory,
      then root directory, then include map for include paths
    - if we find something in the include map, we put it in the state
      - when we get to an object, we empty the include paths
