# What's the plan?

## Feature Requests

- Timing numbers for the resolution of each node
- Single line UI for collecting and resolving nodes
- Ability to select multiple targets at once
- Run a debugger with -debug

# Chores

- Use valgrind to check memory leaks
- Is it cool to pass strings in by value to copy them over in constructors?
- Error handling is terrible.
